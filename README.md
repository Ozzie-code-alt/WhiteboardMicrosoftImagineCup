# WhiteboardMicrosoftImagineCup
This Python code allows any surface to function as an interactive interface. It is specifically designed to be used with projected screens, turning traditional non-interactive projectors into interactive ones. This allows users to better engage with and connect to the projected content, as they no longer need to interact with laptops. The code uses image processing and computer vision algorithms, eliminating the need for extra hardware sensors. As a result, the cost of implementing this system is low, only requiring
a small push button switch and an LED, which is much cheaper than the cost of an interactive whiteboard, which can range from $1000 to $3000.

# Hardware dependencies :

- Webcam (internal laptop webcam or usb webcam).
- LED pen with a push-button switch (Red LED).

# Software Dependencies:

- Python.
- pyautogui.
- pynput.
- OpenCV.
